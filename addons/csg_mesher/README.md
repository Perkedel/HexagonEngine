Add some superpowers to your CSG Shape Nodes!

With CSGMesher, you can quickly output the final static mesh as well as an optional static body and collision shape. You can also quickly set a group on the ouput nodes.

There's an optional 'disable' group for the CSGMesher node itself. This can be useful if you want to disable the node in your own code.

(This addon Node only runs its code in the Editor.)
