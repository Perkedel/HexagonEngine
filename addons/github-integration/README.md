# GitHub Integration
A complete GitHub integration for your Godot Editor! Manage your project without even opening your browser.

Author: *"Nicolo (fenix) Santilio"*  
Version: *0.8.4*  
Wiki: *[supported](https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.github-integration/wiki)*  
Godot Version: *3.2stable*  

## What is this?
*GitHub Integration* is a addon for Godot Engine that I've created mainly for a personal purpose.  
Pushing and Pulling personal repositories while I'm working on Godot (especially if I'm under a GameJam) could take some time and force me to save the project, open the brwoser/git bash/git gui, and do all the stuff.  
With this little addon which works directly in the editor, managing all your repositories will be very easy.  

## How does it work?
I'm currently working on a [Wiki](https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.github-integration/wiki) for this plugin. It is a process that will take some time to complete since I want to provide a well-organized wiki with some basic explanations about GitHub itself. Anyway, I'm working on a user-friendly plugin, so everything should be the very ease to use for GitHub experienced users, and a little intuitive for people who never used GitHub or are not so experienced.
If you want to see some screenshots you can find them here `addons/github-integration/screenshots`

## Supporters page
For my first donation I decided to add a SUPPORTERS.md file where there is a list of people who decided to financially support this plugin. I will never ask for anything in return for the free service I want to offer to  Godot's community, but it will always be an act of kindness that will encourage me to keep my plugins and projects updated.
Here's the [Supporters List](./SUPPORTERS.md)

### About Updates
**Since v0.7.5 I've decided to not update this plugin anymore.**  
It doesn't mean this plugin won't be supported anymore, or I will abandon it: I'm planning to fully migrate this project from a simple GDScript addon to a C++ module for Godot.  
Eventual bugfixes and additional little features will still be implemented if they are needed to support all platforms and to stay updated to Godot Engine's new version, but due to GDScript and Godot limits, I'll migrate the whole code to a C++, fully implemented and optimized GitHub module.  
Please, watch this project or join Discord groups I've mentioned in this page to get all updates.
