# Issues

Godot Style's [issues](https://github.com/VinhPhmCng/GodotStylePlugin/issues) page

## Open

1. Potentially useful links and info regarding GDScript styling and best practices (and more). ([#1](https://github.com/VinhPhmCng/GodotStylePlugin/issues/1))


## Closed

1. No code highlighting for quoting code blocks. ([#2](https://github.com/VinhPhmCng/GodotStylePlugin/issues/2))  

	- This only happens if there is no GDScript file `.gd` opened in your Script dock, for example:
	
	![no_script](addons/godot_style/pictures/no_script.PNG)  
	
	- So all you need to do is open any `.gd` file and re-enable the addon.
