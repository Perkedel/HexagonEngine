<h2>Properties</h2>

<b>visible characters</b>: If set true, the characters (letters) show up with the speed determined trough the speed property

<b>Character Speed</b>: Determines how fast the characters (letters) will show up. The smaller the number the faster the text will be.

<b>Play Sound</b>: If set true, the sound will play after every character that showed up

<b>Use Input Trigger</b>: If set true, after the end of every dialog, the plugin waits for the input_trigger

<b>Text</b>: An Array. Can be used in the editor but is not recommended, it works better with code: show_text(["Hi", "how", "are", "you?"])

<b>Input Trigger</b>: The action which is used to confirm the next dialog (must be picked from the InputMap)

<b>Vertical Margin</b>: Is used to determine the vertical position of the textbox (textbox = the text)

<b>Horizontal Margin</b>: Is used to determine the vertical position of the textbox (textbox = the text)

<b>Textbox Size</b>: The size of the text (not the font size, but the size of the whole text)

<b>Sound</b>: Is only played when use_visible_characters and play_sound is true; Plays after after every character

<b>Font</b>: The font of the text
