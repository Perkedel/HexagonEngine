Introduction
============

Material Maker is a procedural material editor based on the Godot Engine.

It can be used to describe the textures that define a material by interconnecting basic
nodes that generate, transform or combine seamless textures in a graph.

* Generator nodes describe configurable patterns that can be used to create the basic shapes
  and textures of the material.

* Transform nodes change the colors and shapes of their input images to create a more complex
  texture.

* Combine nodes use several input images to generate a new one.

Many nodes in Material Maker are resolution independant, which makes it possible to use transforms
to zoom on an image detail without affecting the generated texture quality. Only a few nodes such
as the image generator and convolution filters (blur, emboss, normal map generation) will limit
the resolution of their output.
