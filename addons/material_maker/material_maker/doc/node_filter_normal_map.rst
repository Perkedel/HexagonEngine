Inputs
++++++

The **Normal map** node accepts a single greyscale image as input, interpreted as a heightmap.

Outputs
+++++++

The **Normal map** node outputs the generated normal map.

Parameters
++++++++++

The **Normal map** node has the following parameters:

* the *format* of the normal map (default, OpenGL or DirectX). The format should
  always be set to "default" when connected to the Normal input of a Material node.
  The correct normal map format for the target game engine will be generated when
  the material is exported.

* the *size* of the normal map

* the *strength* of the normal map effect

* the *buffer* parameter decides if the input must be stored in a buffer before
  generating the normal map. Using a buffer is faster but can create artifacts
  in the normal map, and disabling this option will generate more accurate normal
  maps. It is recommended to enable the buffer while editing a material and
  disable it before exporting.

Notes
+++++

This node outputs an image that has a fixed size.

When using 3D Signed distance functions, it is recommended to use the normal map
generated by the
