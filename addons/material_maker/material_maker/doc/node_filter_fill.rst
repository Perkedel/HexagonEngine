Fill node
~~~~~~~~~

a specific input for the **Fill to random grey**, the **Fill to random color** and
the **Fill to UV** nodes.

Inputs
++++++

The **Fill** node accepts:

* a mask greyscale input whose light parts surround areas that must be filled

Outputs
+++++++

The **Fill** node generates a single RGBA texture that contains the bounding
box of each filled area.

Parameters
++++++++++

The **Fill** node accepts the following parameters:

* *resolution* is the resolution of the effect and only influences how details
  of the mask (and not the source if any) is captured. It is not recommended to
  set this value too high, and completely useless to set it higher than the generated
  textures resolution.
* *iterations* is the number of iterations of the fill algorithm. The optimal value
  for this parameter depends on the input image. Starting with 5 or 10, then increasing
  the value depending on the result is a good way of finding it.
