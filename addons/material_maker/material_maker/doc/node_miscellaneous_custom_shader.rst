Custom shader node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Custom shader** node is an empty node that you can use to start a new shader node.
Just drag it into a graph view, make it editable with **Control-W** and click on the
pencil button.

Depending on the node you intend to create, it may be easier to start from an existing node.
