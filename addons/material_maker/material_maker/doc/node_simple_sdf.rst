2D Signed distance function geometry nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The signed distance function nodes can be used to define complex geometry using simple
shapes.

They are based on a very small set of basic shapes, that can be combined using operators,
and finally output as a greyscale image using the **sdShow** node.

All output samples shown in this sections are images generated through the **sdShow** node.

All Signed Distance Functions nodes are based on code written by Inigo Quilez that can be found
`on this page`__.
