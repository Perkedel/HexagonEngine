Warp node
~~~~~~~~~

The **Warp** node deforms an input image according to the derivative of the second input image.

Inputs
++++++

The **Warp** node accepts two inputs:

* The *Source* inputs is the image to be deformed.

* The *Displace* input is a greyscale image whose derivative will be used to deform the source.

Outputs
+++++++

The **Warp** node outputs the deformed image.

Parameters
++++++++++

The **Warp** node has three parameters:

* *mode*, that defines how the warp node calculates the offset it applies. *Slope* offsets by
  a distance calculated from the slope, and *Distance to top* offsets dy a distance calculated
  from the slope and the distance to the top (this mode makes it posible to make all points
  of a slope get their value from the top, hence generating mosaic-like patterns).

* *strength* to scale the warp effect.

* *epsilon* is used to evaluate the second input's derivative
