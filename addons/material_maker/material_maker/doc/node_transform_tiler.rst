Tiler node
~~~~~~~~~~

The **Tiler** node tiles several instances of its input with optional scale and rotation variations.
Overlapping instances are mixed with each other using a *lighten* filter.

The **Tiler** also has a color version whose input is in RGBA format.

Inputs
++++++

The **Tiler** node accepts two inputs:

* The *Source* inputs is the image to be splat into the output.

* The *Mask* input is a greyscale image that is used as a mask and affects each instance's value.

Outputs
+++++++

The **Tiler** node outputs the splat image.

The greyscale tiler has a secondary output that assigns a random color to each tile.

Parameters
++++++++++

The **Tiler** node accepts the following parameters:

* *Tile X* and *Tile Y*, the number of columns and rows of of the tile pattern.
* *Inputs* is the number of alternate shapes in the input (1, 4 or 16). Images containing several
  shapes can easily be created using the **Tile2x2** node.
* *Fixed Offset* is an offset applied to all odd lines.
* *Offset* is the maximum random offset applied to each instance (relative to tiles size).
* *Rotate* is the maximum angle of the random rotation applied to each instance.
* *Scale* is the amount of scaling applied to each instance.
