Bricks node
~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Bricks** node outputs 4 related bricks pattern textures that can be used for walls
or pavement.

Inputs
++++++

The **Bricks** node accepts 3 optional greyscale input maps for the shape mortar,
bevel and round parameters (the corresponding parameter is multiplied by the map value).

Outputs
+++++++

The **Bricks** node provides the following textures:

* The first one is a greyscale image where bricks are shown in white and mortar in black.

* The second one is a color image where all bricks are drawn using a random uniform color.

* The 3rd and 4th textures are greyscale images of the X and Y position of the center of
  each brick.

* The 5th texture is an UV map texture for each brick (and can be used with the **CustomUV**
  node to apply a texture on each brick)

* the 6th texture is an UV map for each corner of each brick (and can be used with the
  **CustomUV** node to apply a texture on each corner)

Those images can be used together to create complex materials that show for example bricks
of different colors.

Parameters
++++++++++

The **Bricks** node accepts the following parameters:

* the *Pattern* parameter defines the bricks pattern that will be generated.

* the *Repeat* parameter defines the number of patterns on the horizontal and vertical
  axes of the texture.

* the *Rows* parameter defines the number of brick rows in a single pattern of the texture.

* the *Columns* parameter defines the number of brick rows in a single pattern of the texture.

* the *Offset* parameter defines the offset of odd rows of the pattern. This parameter
  only applies to the *Running bond* patterns.

* the *Mortar* parameter defines the relative thickness of mortar in patterns.

* the *Bevel* parameter defines the relative thickness of brick bevel in patterns.

* the *Round* parameter defines the radius of each round corner.

* the *Corner* parameter defines the size of each corner (for the 6th output texture).

Notes
+++++

As with all random nodes, the seed is held by the node's position, so moving the node in the graph
will modify the texture, and the outputs will remain the same if its position and parameters
are not changed.
