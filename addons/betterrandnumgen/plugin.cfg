description="The main goal of this plugin is to create a better random number generator, ie. all digits that come out of it follow a normal distribution. This is because during testing I noted some issues with the Godot PCG random number generator; refer to the provided excel file for my notes, thoughts, and procedures for testing. Additionally this generator does not require preparation to work properly, ie. you do not call randomize() at any point. Finally it adds the ability to generate streams of random numeric digits of any length, output as a string."
