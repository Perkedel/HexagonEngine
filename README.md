# HexagonEngine
 Cinema Enters Game Console Game Engine. 

A Higher Level Application and Game Framework. 

Powered by Godot Engine.
 
# Synopsis
## What is this?
A Godot template to make your games on.

Framework for make things AAA atleast so.
	
## What do you mean?
You can build levels with Level Cartridge. 2D and 3D. all at once! Design Mechanic! like you do in Godot.
	
And most importantly, You can design Cinema quantic animations just like you do in Godot!!! only this time, as same as you do so meticulously

## Huh?
The game runs inside this Hexagon Engine. i.e. your mods are your games!
like Java! but it's Godot.
	
## Why?

Godot is legit a game engine, and more than just that as well. it's THe core! Core of the core!

it's big! full of potential! do anything you'd like! doesn't even have to be game! editors, enterprise softwares, anything!

It also supports AAA game making, with Vulkan! (Since Godot 4.0)
	
We want people to mod this and make games whatever they like.

People want easy and understandable just other that game you can mod and put it on workshop area! people focuses on making level and developers focuses the mechanics of the game for!
	
for us, we have Perkedel Timeline which is a cinematic universe tale! you know Marvel? Yes. Perkedel has their own cinematic universe!
	
## cool but I don't get it.
You'll get it later.
	
Our cinematic universe will be realized using Godot Engine, because this engine's license and their spirit.
	
## Why Godot? why not make own C++?
We have been years searching homes for our universe to live on. 
	
Previous house we have been taught in is not free as in beer and not free as in freedom. Yet if we consider buying one, there is none one that are permanent.
	
the other house we've had reviewed is free as in beer but not freedom. However such house comes great royalty after succession in commercial value and it is not Cheapskate Device friendly.
	
We had ever considered to make our own house but again, it is not efficient idea and would be a boredom generator no matter what team size we are. even worse that all was just Joel himself.
	
We do need to find house that is ready but is free as in both beer and freedom.
	
Sounds fantasy, right? but
	
then finally, we've met a girl named **Godette**. She brought us to her house. We experienced the house and it's really comfortable. it has features we need and covered in an intuitive way.

After we followed the tutorial, we finally declared that Godot Engine will be our forever home to its improbable demise.
	
Right now we are under migration to move things to our new home, as long as our college do not set restriction to previous home we taught in.

yep. it's confirmed. no restriction. we can move in now! takes time, we know, but will eventually done so.
	
## Cool and Good!
Thank your attention. You can help us improve this Git by fork, edit, push, Pull request. we'll review whether it is appopriate mod that should be in this real Git.
	
We accept mods. mods that improves! any improving mods, WELCOME!
	
you can even add Main Menu remix that inherits from original main menu, or make your own Node of main menu from scratch and do make sure you have assigned every connection to the Core Node of Hexagon Engine.
	
## Wait wait wait. one more: "Like Java".. does it contains Java?
Only 1 or some few sets of Java, which will only be used to render for platforms such as Android and platform that based of Java.

and we do not made Java things ourselves. we downloaded some plugins. our scripts are mostly GDscript.
