# Wait. aren't we finish yet?
Wait. we were supposed to adapt the blend file to Godot!

# Bad news. Sketchfab max limit for free version is 50 MB!
We have to sell soul to Sketchfab to allow us upload more than 50 MB.

**NO!!!**

We are not going to be stupid!

## EDIT Sketchfab!
We have Decimated some meshes down drastically. Sketchfab now ***ACCEPT!!!*** yay!!!

the annotation can only be up to 5, more needs subscription!!!

## **WHY IS SKETCHFAB SO PECKING STINGY!!!???**

# Import items
We imported some great random items Joel had made, and put them in the teal cupboard. You know that..

Jason does not like reading Textbook. he likes animated film visualized knowledge book only. Any textbook = **ask for dedd.**
