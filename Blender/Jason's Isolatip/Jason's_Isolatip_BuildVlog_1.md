# Doksek, please explain the build.
Well, I cannot say anything much because I was just told by my boss Master Rumnien "You've got assignment. please build this.". That's it. idk. So I just do what I am paid for, that is, **to build this!** It's fun, engaging! I like building islands, houses, and stuffs!. Next is, to build fence! and uhh, yeah. you can see this blueprint.
# Kaorfa Joel, please explain the build.
Okay. I used Blender. I like blender. So here I placed deformed scaled cube with beveling on it. This main the largest ground here is for some major stuff, typically for farming. but **Jason Harbor** decided not to use this for farming. Instead, for his hobby, like arduino complicated stuffs, rockets, explosion, and experiments like that.

Now there are 2 sub islands on top left corner. the most left is used to put house there. as you can see, there is a house. We haven't yet made its detail inside, other than we did 10 loop cuts to every sides possible, to walls, roof, and washers in between. these 3 we beveled them. the roof there, we drilled octagon in a boolean way using this large octagon log which was made with 8 sided cylinder, and set its viewport display of it as Wire. Unfortunately, Sketchfab cannot see the properties so it look's like a log stuck on a roof! *lol!!!* I should've hide it!!! *XD!!!*

Alright. there is another one next to it. Well, Jason will use this for her daughter's graveyard. but **GREAT NEWS!!!** the daughter did not die. the second sub island purpose is cancelled. I rescued her. indeed. I summoned this superhero, **Riftering**. He is superfast! likes to run in space. likes to take bargain out of just cracked space geode. he likes, crystal. but yeah I made him took "*bargain*" of unusual item on space. it's a human of course, so he immediately deploy his backup oxygen system to her. And as he saw the ownership tag on um, **Lala** 's neck, he went excited as it is Earth he wish to visit, followed the origin for where was she come from, which is Denmark, Earth, Solar System. yeahhh!!! wait. I misadded Jason as Space Viking. oh well whatever. there's a lot of viking born outside Norway hehe!

Back to Lala, as Riftering safely landed Lala back to earth, right where the Jason's office located, Jason caught immediately and cried thancc God Jesus. AND yes, it turns out whole family to remote themselves including Lala! yess! no more pathethic ending! See, **I am not a buthole storywriter unlike other else! I hate tragedic death! tragedic like accident is considered unpeaceful!** death by natural age is, by the way. and **I like Gratis, Open Source, FULL VERSION!!!**

# Cool story!
thancc.
# Oh by the way, What was Jason doing, Kaorfa Joel?
Great question. so, Jason Harbor the Space Viking is an **Entrepreneur**. He hold reality show called **Kids Adventurous** on YouTube, LBRY, BitChute, and a Denmark TV channel. His show is **free, open source, and full version,** but it's not exist in my IRL, sorry. it's on my own Perkedel Cinematic Universe.

What this show does, is Jason enters the kids from all around the world, to a special camp either in Denmark or Indonesia, to build amazing things, do amazing things, and stuffs like that. E.g. Kids do Arduino, Kids Climb mountain, Kids design in Blender, Kids makes delicious foods, Kids uh.. wait I cannot say this too well, but let me be honest, Drive mini EV road legal car, yeah., and... etc. Basically, Kids will become brave adult one day stuff like that. Not limited to boys, but also girls, which is **PECKING GR8!!!!!** hehe!

Recently, today's season of the show, Season 2015, is about **Kids Fly to Space**. Jason had camp to the kids including Lala as usual, to build a spaceship from start to finish, then flies it! There are various shapes of them, but any shape could fly at all! yeah I know it's weird, but I made it flyable anyway. lol.

So far so good. 100% of the kids in the camp could finish the ship. which is **miraculous**. all of them works and could fly, including the oxygening system as well! It's just, fully functional!

Now, it's time for the kids to fly the ship. They held farewell temporary to their parents, and then go. the ship left the atmosphere and are going to the recommended, directed destination which is at around **Sloantim** clusters. each kids flies to different planet in the cluster. all kids then landed their ship there and have fun exploring something, harvesting bargains, or atleast to observe stuffs. most of them goes to harvesting some bargains.

And Done, they went back to the ship to go home. their ship flies, off from the atmosphere, to the earth again. **BUT**, something wrong happened.
- There are some kids went sick, because in space the bacteria get stronger. but luckily all of them curable, because Jason has the Space medikit that cures anything.
- Some others have their ship malfunction. but it was minor, and could be fixed just in couple hour.
- However though, Here is the worst, unfixable. **Pungli Angkasa (Cosmic Levies)**!!!! Much worse than the Earth Levies. They beg you unstopable for the bargain you've just got ("Hey! you must pay if you want to pass!"). And if you refuse, they're going to punch inside to rob yours. This is very dangerous. if the ship got leaked just any size of a hole, it will create huge pressure difference tragedy and sometimes could explode the ship. Luckily, there was only 2 of them who got this incident. One is little, but one is Explosive. the explosive one is Lala's trip but again, **I had summoned Riftering** so yeah, No bad ending in Perkedel Technologies, **ever!**

So yeah. Triangle of the family still lasts atleast. Jason Harbor (Dad), Lala Harbor (Daughter), and Iridium Ion (Mom), goes to Isolatip office and bought remote location to remove themselves once and for all. And they got this. This one is US$345 Billion, has large land for any purpose and large enough sub islands. Speaking about the sub island, the sub island next to the house sub island ended up become used to place the Reputation graveyard. You can see, Jason felt guilty and felt that his reputation will be destroyed the instant as he was the person responsible for "scronching about 2 Million (hint-cite: app/253230)" kids at the same time. So yeah, he decided to build grave stone that is about Kids Adventurous, 

## Here lies my reputation and passion to teach kids non-earthly way. I am so sorry for scronching you all, I have resigned for the best. Shoutout to Riftering for saving Lala.

Yeah like that.

So sad. And That's it for now. thancc for attention

# So, Kaorfa Joel. What is "Kaorfa"?
it's **Perkedel's honorary mentioning name** for Owner of the Cinematic Universe, CEO, Founder, stuff like that. Think this like Sir, Madam, Mister, Miss, Professor, Lord, Bapak, Ibu, Komandan, Letnan, Jendral, something like that. in Perkedel, **you have to call *boss* Kaorfa followed by the name**. which then results **Kaorfa Joel**. Yes. I founded Perkedel Technologies, and I am the first father of Perkedel Kingdom Series.
