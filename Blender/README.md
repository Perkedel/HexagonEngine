# All files will be moved!
In order to reduce repository size in this Hexagon Engine.

As you can see, Godot do not see bunch of `.blend` files. It only sees universally interpretable by most softwares like `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.gltf`, `.dae`, etc. etc.

as the result, we would like to empty this folder from now on, and will only rely `Export Blender` folder which contains `.gltf`s, `.dae`s, etc. etc.

we suspect that all blend files that causes bloat in the repository size.

# Pardon for 404 not found. All files now have been moved!
