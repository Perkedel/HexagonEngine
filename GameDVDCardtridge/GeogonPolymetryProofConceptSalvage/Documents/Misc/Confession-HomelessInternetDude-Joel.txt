I was playing principia, principiagame.com , from bithack.se, a sequel to Apparatus. 
basically you build like an engineer in 2D, visualized in 3D plane. 
YouTube Principia game to get know, hope still exist. 
and one day, Bithack had no success at all to such project, and long later, both Apparatus and Principia were shutdown. 
all uploads of our build lost. lost into void. And all my reputation along with my friends gone. 
I am lost. I went to powdertoy.co.uk to play open source powder sandbox game. 
I attempted myself to build my own scene https://powdertoy.co.uk/User/Saves.html?Name=JOELwindows7 . 
Yes, I got a lot of dislikes because being noob, and miscalculated strategy. I wish my https://powdertoy.co.uk/Browse/View.html?ID=2308053 get likes so much. 
My mistake, and also the server admin fault. I uploaded to online early before the thing finish. any update to the scene won't be pulled back to New list. 
I should have saved locally, but now, it's abandoned. 
I finished, and ready to make it visible, but such an update won't pull that scene back to the top new list like it was uploaded for the first time, 
unlike Principia, whose admin of the server is smart by letting update makes the scene pulled on top. 
yeah. 
I was, now a "homeless" by the term of internet.
btw, before Principia down, I was in large fame. many likes, and subscriber. yeah, now gone into dust of nothingness.
