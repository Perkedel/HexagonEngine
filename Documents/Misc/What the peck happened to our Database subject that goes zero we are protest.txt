Excuse us, dear Mr./Ms.
We have our score for Lab submission for Database System all zero.
At that time, we did followed instruction from the Exam lecturer which says only need 1 people to represent entire group.
We have no idea why this was happened, though we felt that we had correctly followed the procedure.

Also, We did the job ourselves from our own mind. Never think to copy and paste source codes. Even any coincidence might sounds coincidents. We swear that those all jobs are done within the limit of our mind.

Please consider. Thank you for your attention.

The following are the name and NIM of this Group:
Joel Robert Justiawan - 2101629672
Andrew Michael Pujanata - 2101632534
Farel Tiovijay Dededaka 2101666932
