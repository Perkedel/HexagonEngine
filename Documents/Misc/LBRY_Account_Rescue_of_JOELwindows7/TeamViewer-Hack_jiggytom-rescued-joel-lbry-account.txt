did the email get signed out or you did that? Can you sign back in pleasE? 

enter your email and then verify it

hmm - are you sure you didn't have a password setup on Android? 

I previously did password setup. the one I could recall back.

 When was the last time you used the Android app? A while ago? Was there any LBC there? 
OR can I reset that and then get your synced up here without a password for now. Later on we'll allow password change.

- I used Android app just today at the morning
- I have already emptied all LBCs to Desktop wallet.

okay great....

you m ay need to re-sign in on the Android app after I cleare things  up, but then everything should be synced up. 

okay you should be all set now. On android, you'll probably want to clear data / re-sign in . 

Sent 2K LBC over, Enjoy! 

thancc!!! awesome div by zero! alright. let's clear data on android. for good. and re-sign in.
