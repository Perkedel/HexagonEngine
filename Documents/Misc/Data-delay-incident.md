Farel did not wake up during extremely awkward meeting time which is 9.30 , While all reports of datas are all on him. 

It's very late and Farel still not awake yet So, Mr. Hans decrease -10 equal for "No Progress". 

I thought he was a kind person. But after jobs and jobs, I think he now has lost all that.
