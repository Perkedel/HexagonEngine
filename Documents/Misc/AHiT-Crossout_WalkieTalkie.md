# Conclusion

## Suggestions
Gears for Breakfast can try to collab with Gaijin Entertainment. Go ahead. I wish this is real. let's see how my imagination realized like.

## Summarize
It is hype to get these in

# Bonus
I have bad news.

## Uninstalation
I have made backup of save file and store it safe. then uninstalled AHiT. 
**I like this game.** But I've got mods. and these finally builds up to whole 100 GB more of allocations, not even 1 TB fit to fill all my collections. so Big!! 
I want to build new PC! this Budget gaming Laptop succ! I need to build new PC. 
sorry, I have to do this. because my laptop often exploded. lag so sudden. sadd. WHy I have to uninstall AHiT?! why?

## Tunche
Gears for Breakfast collab with Hypetrain Studios and inserted Hat Kid into TUnche. Tunche is made with Unity. Tunche is a rogue-like 2D scroller game. Rumi and friends

https://store.steampowered.com/app/887450/Tunche/

I played the demo that contains Hat Kid. but there is a problem. No, not this game. it's universally every Unity game.

## Unity Graphic Crash
in this budget gaming laptop, every single unity game with Nvidia Game Ready Driver updated to the last, crash. 
When you start to have so many vertices, objects, etc. the graphic *exploded*. hang, but the game still functional, until it should crash report because indeed, **Just that graphic crashes**. 
I've had tried various games that rendered from Unity. no matter what version it was rendered from, any complex graphic crashes the graphic of Unity game. Even my own unity game. 
I had tried the Linux render in Linux boot. We have installed Ubuntu + Nvidia proprietary driver included on this Optane 32 GB NVMe M.2 SSD. just atleast one game. its graphic didn't crash. really? So it's on Windows where it crashes? 
Keep in mind. this laptop had cheapskate GPU setup. Nvidia Optimus, which are Nvidia 1050 Ti + Intel UHD 600. very bad. not epic! Illegal!!! it's comparable with Guitar pick on Bass!

wait. I also even tried to lowest available graphic preset. nope. crashes. want me to try with Tunche? go ahead. maybe later.
## Crossout Crash
To stress even more, I have been Crossout, with unfortunately the workaround of: 

**Select Intel UHD on GPU selection dropdown.**

If I select Auto, or Nvidia GPU lets say. the game crash after login, and when objects is being loaded.

huff! no 300 FPS at all. not epic! very sadd. I want to build new PC!!!

## Easy Anticheat
Huff! Easy Anticheat (belongs to Epic Games) untrusted these drivers dll of SysWOW64 and System32:
- Coolsoft VirtualMIDISynth
- Keppy OmniMIDI
- VST MIDI Driver 

I suspected that the untrusted file issue cause it to crash. I tried to reinstall the Anticheat again using included utility. no work. 
so I uninstalled the '*offending*' drivers above. very sadd. 

**now it's gone**. no more message like this. even more sadd! **why?!**

**Easy Anticheat now scans dll too** especially both in System32 and SysWOW64 folder of Windows. the blacklister client from those MIDI driver client won't work anymore since it only prevent exe scanning.

## COVID-19
Hey Gaijin. how about adding this *Pandemic virus* themed season? wouldn't it be cool? We are uh, stuck at home. cannot go anywhere. muss stop spread. idk. Hand Wash. Masker. **Toilet Paper**.

Yeah you gotta think about it.

## Yamaha Genos.
things goes ***Gebos***. Coronavirus pandemic is here. cannot go to mall. to visit exhibition of Yamaha keyboard. it's in Artha gading. huuh. sadd.

I've been dreaming for my whole life such as this to **touch Yamaha Genos, experience it, and owns it.**
