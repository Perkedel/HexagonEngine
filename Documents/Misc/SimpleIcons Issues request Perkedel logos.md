**Post Scripts:** 
- We let SimpleIcons add our brand icons (if they wanted to) despite our brand logos are licensed CC4.0-BY-SA, due to a fact many brand logos that are licensed other than CC0 but other Creative Commons Licenses or GNU GPL, and *ones whose aren't even open source* exist in SimpleIcons repository, all usable under CC0. Oh well. Why not us too? We `Share and Serve for Gratis, Open Source, and FULL VERSION!!!`, and those companies whatever they are, are glad for their logos in there. yeah. go ahead. Our name has to be preserved in more places.
- We would like if you'd like to add at least both version where there are
- A Pull Request may be made if necessary.
- Sorry for longpost. I also have analyzed other Request issues as well to learn and inspire how do they request here.
