### Level (Called TimePiece)

Make sure to have the level you are about to Subscribe is **On Date**. if you ran a level that its Render Cook is **outdated**, your game will crash and sees **Please Recook**.

So before you eager to subscribe, Middle click on that Mod square box to open the Mod page in new window. Scroll to comment. if you saw **"Please recook!!!"** request comment, avoid subscribing until the author of the Mod recooked and uploaded it. The confirmation should be commented like **"Level Updated!", "Recooked!", etc.**
### Plugins

### Hats
Most hats are flair while some gives way another function.

Be careful. some mod have bug where it causes that hat to always wear at the finish loading. some may crash the game because **Invalid Hat Value**.
### Weapon
Most weapons are flairs. but some have way more different functions!

ugh. I am tired!
## But what I Have / wish GOG?
for AHiT case, it is unlike Cyberpunk 2077 (which is by CD Projekt Red & they also own GOG, so absolutely alergy to *DRM* by nature). Some functionalities are missing due to the API used such as Online 50 Multiplayer that based on Steam Networking API.

## The Screenshot COntained SPOILER!!! ALERT!!!
Some or most of these screenshots **contains spoiler! Because this game is not $0, Perkedel allows anyone to be spoiled ONLY IF THEY ARE WILLING TO OWN AHiT.** (What-if scenario) If only the game was $0 and easy to run on most cheapskate hardwares, Perkedel restrict everyone to be spoiled until they finished the game completely.

## How to screenshot in game?
Press **F12** while you are in any game that ran from Steam. by default, your keymap should be configured there.
## But I am not in Steam!
Use direct OS Screenshot!

Windows = META (Win) + PrintScreen

Linux, GNOME Desktop, and maybe other desktop environments? = PrintScreen

# YouTube Version
Either YouTube or Olive Video Editor may have bugs.

Any Video rendered from Olive at any Resolution even 4K, will result on YouTube Upload as low as 360p.

We have no idea why. Sorry for Inconvenience.

But we have got workarounds.

We put Olive render file to Blender Video editor. https://blender.org 

then render with as similar specification as possible. reread 4K DCI refference on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution#Resolutions

Yes. Blender Filtering should make this work.
