he has 3 locked posts.
Highest tier: Just Donate Part 2 $10

He is known as Mr. Open Source, likes to share things for $0, shares the source code, and do not break them to pieces.

but this particular one called "UV rest" is locked and the censored says you have to go to a link where you can get it free and advise to not become patron at all.

I think he doesn't want to censor it actually, rather it must be because of Patreon Terms of Service.

pls add me! I wanted to spread awareness about paywallism a.k.a. Expensivisim and why it is bad for everyone mostly.
