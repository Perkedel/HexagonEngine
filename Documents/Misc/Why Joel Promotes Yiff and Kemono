# Why Joel promotes yiff.party and kemono.party?
Well some of you may have heard this. basically these are to archive Patreons, Fantia, Gumroad and some more paywaller host system, then share them for $0.

Some artist too have had acknowledged this, and complained about it.

let me tell you guys this.

## Money potential surge flow, additional boost of revenues
The importer system requires you to pledge a tier at least certain level in order for the importer to be able to see and copy the post.

You should start to subscribe your favourite creator a bunch of monet by choosing which tier you'd like. it is best to have the highest one if you are not sure, but if you are certain that all of the any paywalled post only need you to become a patron of them, you can just become lowest tier patron otherwise.

after that, you'll go to the importer and submit your cookie of your session after you've subscribed to some creators. Then wait for few days for your favourite creator to appear in the import site.

**It is recommended that you keep subscribing as long as you can, as the creator may make more post, therefore**

## THE CREATOR ALWAYS WINS SUBSCRIPTION MONEY, AS LONG THEY WANTED TO KEEP YIFFING, OR SOMETHING ELSE!!!

# Mitigation, PM Exclusivity, Censorship, Oath to not Yiff, etc.

So let's say this creator devastated about "my content has been pirated!!!". https://www.wired.com/story/patreon-porn-piracy-yiffparty/

then, the creator wanted to report but... https://yiff.party/removals you have to entirely quit your life from being Expensivist, Paywalling. If they found you create again, you're done. you'll be ignored for good and people will happy to pirate you. serious.

What do they gonna do? Oh yeah. They do this. **Mitigations**.

They will do bunch of loopholes such as `PM Exclusive`, `Time limit, `Limited Tier seat`, and so on so on. even from my original thought is about `Oath to not Yiff`, which basically is giving Non-Yiff-Kemono Agreement Signable pledge of oath, that you are in oath to not ever yiff kemono whom establish this oath and if you violate the whom will punish you with block or something something even worse.

Assuming creators do not have any knowledge whose patron that may have been yiffing, yiffers could still download the PM exclusive rewards and reshare them to a special tab room called `Shared Files`, into the respective creator page.

So yeah. Oh and also take a look at 
https://www.patreon.com/posts/patreon-joel3d-34922093 

in his recent comment he stated that **he'll directly share rewards to patrons over PM, and censored to yiffers**. Pathethic. smol pp! not epic. not approved!

that's a surprise paywall. I will not support this behaviour!

## Will Joel do suprise paywall too?
No. 

Specifically, **We never allow every single paywall in any Open Source platform, except Proprietary and/or Expensive platforms like App Store, Google Play, etc. etc.**

In addition we also **Forces everyone in Perkedel to publicly share SOURCE CODE for $0, without any bad term, even a pixel.** We expect you credit us when remixing it and/or using it. that's all.

# What if Yiff and/or Kemono cease to exist?
let's say the creator found a way to collab with Top Level Domain and its Final Domain Authority. look at this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpQZVYPuDGU to learn how Website resolving works.

anyway, so they got yiff.party and kemono.party got **YEETED** out of existence. poof into dust. also got the servers FBI raided as well.

What will happend?

## Creator will gain even much more money but...

As the archive "pirate" site has been scronched, people then are forced to pay accordingly just to get the access. Now the question is:

**Where are they getting those money from?** is it, `bank robbery`,`steal parent credit card`, `own revenue`, or what?

So yes. you'll be rich but you're a buthole and indirect crime supporter since **Money stealing crimes will increase drastically, and rapidly!** hahahahhaaa. serious.
