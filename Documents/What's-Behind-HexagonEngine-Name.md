# What's behind the name of "Hexagon Engine"?
Why this framework is named Hexagon Engine?
## Background
### Discovery
Joel discovered Little Nightmare during its showtime circa 2016. here is the website, steam, and stuff:

https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares

https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares

### Character that called Six, who wears Yellow Raincoat
So the thing intrest him is that, the main character.
Main character bears the following gears and attributes:
- Yellow Raincoat
- Flint-Wheel strike match
- 12% comparison size than larger ones. suspectably / presumably larger ones are larger than us the common *Homo sapiens* perhaps.
- uh, what else?
- female
- also **stunk** in this terrible water ship called **Maw**.
- etc. etc.

He also noticed things that bugs him:
- Doll house camera viewpoint
- eh meh eh meh audio visual play point. general Unreal surround presumably
- not free both as in beer and freedom.

### Inspired to Remake this Little Nightmare
Then, he wish to remake this game and make a sequel out of it that Joel says to rescue Six away from depressive situation and restore who were scronched and spoiler alert: **Nomed**
during the captive at this terrible water ship.

He planned to make levels about:
- The main (Six, Sven Runaway kid)(just Runaway kid officially, no name)
- Escape. Escaped to the south of Java island, bridge, broke, PikSik rescued, and
- Restoration Series Commander Zeni (Ctrl+Z). Restore Six and people were this this and that.
- Custom Infiltration of a cartel headquarter. action involved! FPS viewpoint with anaesthetic wepons. accompanied with fortress-like friends
- Yellow softbody room tunnel level as an extra
- Restore this beloved girl from a rich businessman and that sister of that boy from 1st comic. mini wars involved but then Law dimension people caught the North Wind after the war went too crazy, so crazy it is too dangerous for any being around it. Law then sentenced North Wind mafias guilty and forever prison. Law also restored stuffs which some of them are about freed the hostage such as this beloved girl, sister of that boy, and a Nokia 3310 2015 version stolen but Law then bought it according to the price of around Rp 500rb to confiscate but actually buy that revised infamous Nokia feature phone.
- Restore this Mirror phobia girl from 2nd comic.
- and more Six is hero stuffs. that's not a name so we call her Harumi.

### Name and design
Then come to the name of this remake of.
We had come with idea of

**The Yellow Raincoat Group**

because it is all about Six and friends. But one day we had thought about

**Hexagon Engine**

because Perkedel Cinematic universe was (will be) started from collaboration with Tarsier and Bandai Namco for Little Nightmare where basically, it is

**SIX**, number 6.

so according to the name we designed the logo using a hexagon geometry and put 6 dice dots on it like this https://www.instagram.com/p/BV5vrGZlOzU/ here. Basically, to revolve around number six in a good way and tried best to avoid such unwanted refference fanatic priest would complain so. We realise the Beast number is existed and **mentioned in the Bible** (Relevation 13:18) so we have to be careful defining what is good with Harumi's number 6.

## Evolutions
And there it is. But unfortunately, at that time, he wasn't able to play video games due to its online payment concern and price that are not a few (not $0 software is considered really expensive).

Time passes. Joel discovered even more characters he is intrigued to get collab of and restore what has been lost if any. here are some of the following franchise Joel has been discovered and intrigued to contact the entity owning it:
- Laika: Kubo, Coraline, ParaNorman?, yes.
- Disney: Star vs. the Forces of Evil (many aspects even to the new Magic without racism to actually good hearted monster and unfortunately cannot involve Tony Stark for it), Mickey Mouse, etc. etc.
- Warner Bros: We Bare Bears, Adventure Time, Infinity Trains, etc. etc.
- Wintergatan: these Musicals!!! Marble Machine X!!!
- Tarsier again: uh... that Mars Girl (Azokawa Hanimura the chef) we got. special episode. Mars girl who is being chased by evil mafia who looking for her heart for some sort of guro. so she fled to a bunker. Six and friends helped her flee away more.
- etc. et.c

If any of your company are there, you'll be soon contacted by Joel or his licensor speaker from Perkedel Licensing Division.
However, if your name are not there, do not shrink your heart yet. Joel might have forgotten the name because he had thought the idea for the past few years. also, your company may suddenly be contacted for collab if your franchise intrests him.

We'll prepare the monet accordingly and appropriately.

## Verdict
Hexagon Engine has been planed for so long journey of cinematic universe that involves a lot of 3rd party franchises that intrest him. Not limited to 3rd party content but also original content that may or not interact with each other. It will become one of the only source of Free as in beer and Free as in freedom cinematic universe, everyone must see or play this without looking someone's gameplay on Tube first, unless they had already played it or computer spec is not enough.
