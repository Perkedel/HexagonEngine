# What's behind the name of "Hexagon Engine"?
Why this framework is named Hexagon Engine?
## Background
Joel discovered Little Nightmare during its showtime circa 2016. here is the website, steam, and stuff:

https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares

https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares

So the thing intrest him is that, the main character.
Main character bears the following gears and attributes:
- Yellow Raincoat
- Flint-Wheel strike match
- 12% comparison size than larger ones. suspectably / presumably larger ones are larger than us the common *Homo sapiens* perhaps.
- uh, what else?
- female
- also **stunk** in this terrible water ship called Maw.
- etc. etc.

He also noticed things that bugs him:
- Doll house camera viewpoint
- eh meh eh meh audio visual play point. general Unreal surround presumably
- not free both as in beer and freedom.

Then, he wish to remake this game and make a sequel out of it that Joel says to rescue Six away from depressive situation and restore who were scronched
during the captive at this terrible water ship.
